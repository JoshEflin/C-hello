 ##Pointers

  pointers are variables that store the address of another variable.


  int a;   is an int variable

  int*p= &a   p is a pointer to an integer a.

  double b;  b is a double.

  double *q q is a pointer to a double.


  int a = 10;

  int *p= &a;
  
  a = 20; sets a to 20

  *p = 30; sets a to 30

  could be read as (set the variable that p points to equal to 30
  as opposed to setting p to the address 30
