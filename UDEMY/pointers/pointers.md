In C, when you declare a pointer variable, like int *p;, you are telling the compiler that p is a pointer to an integer. However, when you use the malloc function to allocate memory dynamically, you need to explicitly cast the result of malloc to the type of pointer you intend to use. Here's why:

    Type Safety: C is a strongly typed language, and it requires that you provide the correct data type information when working with memory allocation functions like malloc. The malloc function returns a void* (a generic pointer), which can be assigned to any pointer type. However, when you assign it to a specific pointer type, you're telling the compiler how to interpret the memory. This helps catch type-related errors at compile-time.

    Compatibility: Older C compilers (pre-C89) required casting the result of malloc because they didn't support implicit conversions from void* to other pointer types. While modern C compilers are more lenient and allow you to omit the cast, it's still considered good practice to include it for clarity and to ensure compatibility with older code or compilers.

So, in your code, when you write p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));, you are explicitly casting the void* returned by malloc to an int* because you intend to use it as a pointer to an integer. However, you can also write it like this:

c

p = malloc(sizeof(int));

Modern C compilers will accept this code because they can implicitly convert void* to other pointer types. Nevertheless, adding the cast is a matter of style and clarity, and it won't affect the behavior of your code as long as you are correctly allocating and managing memory.
