# C-hello

This repository if a playground for learning C. There is nothing good in here. I promise

It's mostly a collection of random C files and markdown files which comprise of notes.

Perhaps over time I'll make something from this  but for now I'm just taking notes and tinkering,

feel free to use the notes
